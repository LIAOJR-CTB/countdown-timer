# countdown-timer
I am using Expo (https://github.com/expo/expo) as my developing tools for React Native as well as some of their pretty libraries. Please follow the Expo doc to install the expo-cli 
Some codes are from https://github.com/Snowfighter/PomodoroTimer because I don't want to build from scratch due to my time limitations, I search the Gothub and find this repos. 
This is a propotype , still need a lot of time to realize my ideas
